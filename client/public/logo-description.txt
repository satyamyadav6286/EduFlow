EduFlow Logo Description

The EduFlow logo consists of:

1. A dark background (#111827)
2. A grid of 9 white dots arranged in a 3x3 pattern on the left side
3. Text "Edu" in white and "Flow" in pink (#ff3366)
4. Clean, modern typography with a bold sans-serif font

The dots represent structure and organization in education, while the two-tone text illustrates the flow of knowledge from traditional education (white) to modern, dynamic learning approaches (pink).

The logo's clean design works well in both light and dark environments and scales appropriately for various display contexts.
